    "Basketball players in the NBA are often judged by the “basic” statistics: how many points do you score, how many rebounds do you get, and so on. However, the game is deeper than just these surface level stats. How can a player like Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors, whose traditional stats are pedestrian at best, be a 3-time All-Star with 3 NBA championships? In my project, I am looking into more advanced statistics to examine what we miss when we judge players based on just their points, rebounds, and assists. To do so, I have collected NBA player data across 6 seasons from BasketballReference and 538 which cover many more advanced aspects of the game."

    "The easiest way to judge NBA players is by how well they shoot the ball. Field goal percentage (the percentage of your shots which go into the basket) and points scored per game are often metrics by which the league's best players are compared. These statistics are easy to count, and have an obvious impact on any game you watch. To try to easily aggregate and display, I performed a principal component analysis on 6 typical offensive statistics (percentage of three-pointers made, percentage of two-pointers made, free throw attempts, free throws percentage, shots attempted, and assists) in order to capture the impact a player has offensively."

It is often difficult to tell who is guarding who on a given possession, let alone what impact they have on a shot. However, the politics and sports statistics site FiveThirtyEight tried to quantify the average impact a defender has on a shot using spatial data to see who was the closest defender on a given shot. By adjusting for the skill of the shooter, they were able to come up with a metric which captures the change in field goal percentage that a player provides on whomever they are guarding."

However, with the exception perhaps of 2014 and 2019, he is consistently well above the average player. It appears as though his 2016 and 2017 All-NBA labels are well justified, and he may have deserved to receive the award in 2015 as well. This is despite having an offensive impact which is only around the league average, yet made up for by exceptional defense. It is safe to say that over this period, Green was worthy of the accolades he received and the credit he was given as an integral part of the Golden State Warriors during their 3 championship seasons.\n"
